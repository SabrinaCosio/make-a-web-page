  <body><b>"The Beginning of HTML Prgraming"</b>
    </div>
      <p>
        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. The web is made up of billions of HTML documents. Your computer submits a HTTP request to a server everytime you search for a webpage. The server finds the document you are looking for and sends that document to your computers browser. The browser interprets the page and displays it on your computer.

        HTML is the heart of the web and is made up of various parts such as: Text content, Mark-up, links and References

    <div>
      <p>
        More complex HTML will feature attributes like <a href="reddit.com"> links</a>.<br>
      </p>
    </div>

        We also learn the difference between <em>inline and block elements</em>.<br> <b>Inline</b> does not create a new block of content, such as the span tag, or the break tag, where as <b>Block</b> will create a new block of content, such as the paragraph tag, or the div tag. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

   <div><b>Structuring HTML</b></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        HTML, CSS, and Java/js, all work together to create a more structured webpage. If thought of together in the context of a house, HTML would be the frame or the walls, CSS would be the paint and decorations, and js would be the TV remote, or garage door opener. These three work together to make one cohesive home, or in this case, website that allows the site to be user friendly. The more these elements work together, the more fluid and smooth the experience will be for the end user.

          Using a browser such as chrome will allow you to open the developer tools and see the code for any website. Within these developer tools, you can see the <b><em>Document Object Model</b></em> or <b>DOM</b>. The DOM is the tree like structure that is the breakdown of the HTML elements. If it were to be drawn out on paper, it would be like seeing the family tree of a website.

     <span><b>BOXES!!!</b>
      <div>
        <p>
          Everything, and it really seems to be true, <b><em>EVERYTHING</b></em> seemes to be a box on any website. Boxes allow for ease of placement. In the initial design of a website, just laying out boxes, regardless of content, will help with how fluid the page is. When HTML is read as a text, it is seen as a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The further the indent, the deeper in that box

     <span><b>Text editing</b>
      <div>
        <p>
          Text editors such as Sublime text, or CodePen, allow people to code with much more ease. These are editors specifially designed to code.
